# Final Fantasy Tactics Style Seamless Texture Generation Guide

## Project Goal
Generate seamless, tileable textures for procedural map generation in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics (PSX), featuring:
- 16-color palette limitation (PSX era aesthetic)
- Low detail, non-busy textures
- Isometric/tactical perspective
- Seamless tiling capability

## Understanding the Challenge

### Why FFT Textures Are Unique
1. **Limited Color Palette**: PSX-era 16 colors per texture creates a distinct, unified look
2. **Low Visual Noise**: Textures are simplified, not photorealistic
3. **Hand-Painted Feel**: Artists manually created these with careful color choices
4. **Dithering**: PSX often used dithering patterns to create gradients within palette limits
5. **Tile-Friendly Design**: Patterns naturally repeat without obvious seams

### Why Standard AI Generation Is Hard
- Modern Stable Diffusion models are trained on photorealistic images
- They add detail and complexity by default
- Seamless tiling requires special techniques
- 16-color palette restriction needs post-processing or fine-tuned models

## Approach 1: LoRA Training (Recommended for Style Consistency)

### What You Need
**Training Data Collection:**
- Extract texture tiles from FFT (use emulator screenshots or sprite rips)
- Get texture sheets from: https://www.spriters-resource.com/playstation/finalfantasytactics/
- You need 20-100+ examples for a good LoRA
- Focus on JUST textures (grass, stone, water, dirt, etc.) not full maps

**What to Collect:**
```
Good training examples:
- Individual 64x64 or 128x128 texture tiles
- Ground textures: grass, dirt, stone, sand, snow
- Each texture should be tileable (seamless edges)
- Include variety: light grass, dark grass, rocky dirt, etc.

Bad training examples:
- Full map screenshots (too much context)
- Sprite sheets with UI elements
- Character sprites mixed with terrain
```

### LoRA Training Process

**Step 1: Prepare Dataset**
1. Extract/collect 50-100 FFT terrain textures
2. Crop to consistent size (512x512 recommended for SD1.5, 1024x1024 for SDXL)
3. Upscale the original low-res textures using nearest-neighbor (keeps pixel art sharp)
4. Tag each image: "fft terrain texture, grass, seamless, 16bit, pixel art, tactical rpg"

**Step 2: Choose Training Approach**

Option A: **Kohya_ss** (most popular)
- https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss
- GUI-based, easier for beginners
- Good tutorials available

Option B: **AI-Toolkit** (newer, simpler)
- https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit
- Better for small datasets

**Step 3: Training Settings** (approximate - tune as needed)
```yaml
# For pixel art style LoRA
base_model: "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"  # or SD 1.5 variant
resolution: 512x512
batch_size: 2-4
learning_rate: 0.0001
network_dim: 32  # LoRA rank
network_alpha: 16
max_train_steps: 1500-3000
```

**Expected Result:**
A LoRA that understands FFT's color palette, simplification style, and texture patterns.

### Pros & Cons of LoRA Approach
✅ **Pros:**
- Consistent FFT style across all generations
- Can be combined with seamless tiling workflows
- Reusable for your entire project

❌ **Cons:**
- Requires collecting/preparing training data
- Takes time to train (hours on good GPU)
- May need multiple iterations to get right
- Still won't guarantee 16-color palette (needs post-processing)

## Approach 2: Seamless Texture Generation (No Training Required)

### ComfyUI Workflows for Seamless Tiles

**Method A: Offset/Wrap Technique**

This is the classic approach:
1. Generate initial texture with SD
2. Cut it into 4 quadrants and swap corners to center
3. Inpaint the seam in the middle
4. Result: seamless tile

**ComfyUI Nodes Needed:**
- `Load Checkpoint` (use SD 1.5 or SDXL)
- `CLIP Text Encode` (for prompts)
- `KSampler` (generation)
- `ImageScale` (resize if needed)
- **Seamless nodes**: Look for custom nodes like:
  - "Seamless Tile" node
  - "Make Circular" node
  - Or manual crop/inpaint approach

**Method B: Circular/Toroidal Convolution**

Some custom nodes make textures seamless by using circular padding during generation.

**Search for these ComfyUI custom nodes:**
- `ComfyUI-Seamless`
- `ComfyUI-TiledKSampler`
- These modify how the model generates to ensure edges match

### Prompting Strategy for FFT-Style

**Good Prompts:**
```
"simple grass texture, low detail, pixel art style, tactical rpg,
16bit graphics, flat colors, no shadows, seamless tile, top-down view"

"stone floor texture, medieval, simplified, low poly style,
flat shading, limited palette, tactical rpg, seamless"

"dirt path texture, pixel art, tactical rpg, PSX graphics,
dithered, 16 colors, simple, clean, tileable"
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
"photorealistic, detailed, high resolution, 3D render,
busy pattern, complex, gradient, smooth, blurry, modern"
```

**Key Prompt Terms:**
- "pixel art" - helps reduce photorealism
- "tactical rpg" / "PSX" - style guidance
- "flat colors" - reduces shading complexity
- "simple" / "low detail" - fights SD's tendency to add noise
- "16bit" / "limited palette" - palette hints (won't enforce 16 colors though)

## Approach 3: Hybrid Workflow (Recommended)

Combine AI generation with post-processing for best results:

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**1. Generate Base Texture (ComfyUI)**
- Use seamless tiling workflow (Method A or B above)
- Prompt for simplified, pixel art style
- Generate at higher resolution (512x512 or 1024x1024)

**2. Post-Process to FFT Style**

**Reduce to 16 Colors:**
Tools needed:
- **Aseprite** (paid but excellent for pixel art): Color quantization
- **GIMP** (free): Image → Mode → Indexed → 16 colors
- **ImageMagick** (command line):
  ```bash
  convert input.png -colors 16 -dither FloydSteinberg output.png
  ```

**Apply Dithering:**
FFT uses dithering patterns. After color reduction, apply ordered dithering:
```bash
# ImageMagick with ordered dithering
convert input.png -colors 16 +dither -ordered-dither o4x4 output.png
```

**3. Downscale (Optional)**
If you want authentic low-res look:
```bash
# Scale down then back up with nearest-neighbor
convert input.png -scale 25% -scale 400% output.png
```

**4. Verify Seamless Tiling**
- Tile the texture 2x2 or 3x3 in image editor
- Check for visible seams
- If seams exist, use clone stamp or inpaint to fix

---

## Approach 4: Controlnet + Reference Images

If you have FFT texture references:

**Workflow:**
1. Get FFT texture as reference
2. Use ControlNet (Tile or Reference mode)
3. Generate variations while maintaining style

**ComfyUI Setup:**
- Load FFT reference texture
- Use ControlNet Tile preprocessor
- Denoise strength: 0.4-0.7 (keeps style, adds variation)
- Result: New textures similar to FFT style

**Best For:**
- Creating variations of existing FFT textures
- "More grass like this, but darker"
- Maintaining exact style without LoRA training

---

## Recommended Starting Point

### For Quick Testing (Today):
1. **Install ComfyUI seamless tile custom nodes**
2. **Use this prompt template:**
   ```
   Positive: "simple [grass/stone/dirt] texture, pixel art,
   tactical rpg, PSX style, flat colors, low detail, seamless tile"

   Negative: "photorealistic, detailed, complex, 3d, gradient, modern"
   ```
3. **Generate 512x512 texture**
4. **Post-process:**
   - Reduce to 16 colors in GIMP/Aseprite
   - Apply dithering
   - Test tiling

### For Best Long-Term Results:
1. **Collect FFT texture dataset** (50-100 textures)
2. **Train a LoRA** (weekend project)
3. **Combine LoRA + seamless workflow**
4. **Post-process** to 16-color palette
5. **Build texture library** for your procedural system

## Technical Considerations

### Texture Resolution for Your Game
**Original FFT:** ~64x64 pixels per tile (very low res)

**Your Options:**
- **Authentic (64x64)**: Matches PSX perfectly, very limited detail
- **Enhanced (128x128 or 256x256)**: Keeps style but allows more clarity
- **Recommendation**: Generate at 512x512, then downscale to your target resolution

### Palette Management
**Option 1: Global Palette**
- All textures share one 16-color palette
- More authentic to PSX limitations
- Harder to implement

**Option 2: Per-Texture Palette**
- Each texture has its own 16 colors
- Easier to generate
- Less authentic but more practical

### Procedural Map Considerations
Since your map is procedural:
- **Need variety**: Generate 5-10 variations per terrain type
- **Transition tiles**: Create edge blend textures (grass→dirt, dirt→stone)
- **Context aware**: Maybe have "wet grass", "dry grass", "trampled grass" variations

## Questions to Consider

Before diving in:

1. **Resolution target**: What pixel size will your game use? (64x64? 128x128? Higher?)
2. **Palette strategy**: Global palette or per-texture?
3. **Perspective**: True isometric or 3/4 view like FFT?
4. **Variation needs**: How many unique textures do you need?
5. **Animation**: Will textures animate (water, lava)? That changes the approach.

---

## My Recommendation

**Start Simple, Then Iterate:**

**Week 1 - Testing:**
- Generate textures with basic prompts + seamless workflow
- Post-process to 16 colors manually
- See if style is close enough

**Week 2 - If Results Are Good:**
- Scale up generation
- Build texture library
- Integrate with procedural system

**Week 2 - If Results Aren't Good:**
- Invest time in LoRA training
- Collect proper FFT dataset
- Train and iterate on LoRA
- Then return to generation

**The LoRA route is more work upfront but gives you consistent, reusable style for the entire project.**

## Final Thoughts

Your instinct is correct: **photorealistic models won't work well without significant post-processing or training**. FFT's style is very specific - low detail, limited palette, hand-crafted feel.

The good news: **This is totally achievable!** Others have trained pixel art LoRAs successfully. The key is:
1. Good training data (FFT-specific textures)
2. Seamless tiling workflow
3. Post-processing for 16-color palette
4. Testing and iteration

You're essentially creating a **texture synthesis pipeline**, not just one-off generation. Think of it as a tool you'll build once and use many times.

Good luck! Let me know which approach you want to try first and I can help you get started.
